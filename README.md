## Cybersecurity for Kids

An interactive educational website teaching children aged 9â€“12 about online safety through games, videos, and quizzes.

# Tech Stack
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

# Key Learnings
1. Designed interactive web content with a pedagogical focus.
2. Collaborated in a cross-functional team for UI/UX, accessibility, and narrative design.
3. Gained insight into communicating technical concepts to non-technical audiences.
  
## Network Design Lab

Networking Summary (CCNA1â€“CCNA3)

Focus: End-to-end understanding of network design, configuration, and security using Cisco technologies.
1. Built and configured small to medium enterprise networks in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Mastered IPv4/IPv6 addressing, subnetting, static and dynamic routing (OSPF).
3. Implemented VLANs, trunking, STP, EtherChannel, and inter-VLAN routing for scalable LANs.
4. Configured DHCP, NAT, ACLs, and applied LAN security (port security, DHCP snooping, ARP inspection).
5. Set up wireless networks, WAN connections, VPN/IPsec tunnels, and QoS for traffic prioritization.
6. Introduced to cryptography, network virtualization, and automation concepts.
7. Applied network management, troubleshooting, and design principles based on Cisco best practices.
Key outcome: Strong practical and theoretical competence across all CCNA domains; routing, switching, wireless, WAN, and security.
